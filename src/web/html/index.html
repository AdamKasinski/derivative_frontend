        <h1>Financial derivatives</h1>
        <p class="introduction"> Derivatives are financial securities whose value is derived from 
            an underlying asset or group of assets. They are contracts between 
            two or more parties, and their price is dependent on changes in the 
            underlying asset, which can be stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, 
            interest rates, or market indexes. Essentially, derivatives are used 
            for hedging risks or speculating on the future price of an asset. 
            Hedging allows individuals and businesses to protect themselves against 
            price movements that could incur losses. Speculators, on the other hand, 
            take on this risk in the hopes of making a profit.

            <h1> About the page</h1>
            <p> The page allows to price most common derivatives, i.e bonds, forwards, swpas and options
                - both vanila and exotic. Vanila options are calculated based on 3 diffenet models - Black-Scholes,
                trees and Monte Carlo simulations with variance reduction methods. In the future more derivatives will
                be added.
